# Rusted Iron

Iron MQ build with Rust

## Prerequisites
We used [Rocket](https://rocket.rs) which is required nighlty version of Rust.
Once `rustup` is installed, configure Rust nightly as your default toolchain by running the command:
```
rustup default nightly
```
If you prefer, once we setup a project directory in the following section, you can use per-directory overrides to use the nightly version only for your Rocket project by running the following command in the directory:
```
rustup override set nightly
```
